 * carries its callId, so a tool_call/result pair is never structurally broken.
 *
 * The v0 folder is deliberately dumb: no Conductor, no relevance. It folds purely
 * to keep the live context under budget, oldest-first, lowest-value-first —
 * tool_results before thinking before reply text before tool_calls before user
 * intent. Deterministic and explainable; the smarts come later.
