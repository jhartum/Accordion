# ADR 0011 — Conductor involvement locks: from "the human always wins" to "the human can always leave"

**Status:** accepted (product-level alignment session)
**Date:** 2026-06-17
**Amends a founding invariant — read this first:** ADR 0007's **"Human GUI overrides
always win"** and VISION's **"This protection is absolute"** both become **conditional**
on a conductor's declared lock-set. This is a deliberate fork in what Accordion *is*, not
a tweak; the product docs (VISION.md, README.md, CLAUDE.md) are rewritten to own it.
**Builds on:** [ADR 0007](0007-conductor-protocol.md) (the conductor contract —
`conduct → Command[]`, clamp reports, the override rule this ADR makes conditional),
[ADR 0008](0008-conductor-first-party-one-view.md) (first-party conductors; one public
view), [ADR 0005](0005-agent-unfold.md) (the agent `unfold` tool + `{#code FOLDED}` tags —
`recall` sits beside it), [ADR 0006](0006-multiblock-folds.md) (groups).

## Context

A conductor is a context-management strategy ([ADR 0007](0007-conductor-protocol.md)). Today
every conductor is **collaborative** by force: a human can yank a pin, hand-fold, or
hand-unfold at any moment, and the live agent can `unfold` whatever it wants — and all of
that overrides the conductor mid-run. "Human overrides always win" was the founding trust
anchor: automation is safe *because* you can always reach in and overrule it surgically.

That anchor makes conductors hard to author and hard to test. A strategy that has reasoned
its way to a particular folded state cannot rely on that state surviving to the next turn —
a stray human pin or an agent self-unfold can fight it, and the author has no deterministic
world to reason about. The owner wants conductors to be able to **declare that they take
uncontested control** of specific controls, so their authors get determinism, and so users
can *choose* between a **co-pilot** conductor they steer alongside and an **autopilot**
conductor they hand the keys to.

That is the change here: a conductor may **declare** that it locks certain context controls;
the user **approves** the lockout when attaching it; and the human's remaining recourse
becomes the **kill switch (detach)** — not surgical override. **Trust moves from *override*
to *revocability*.** Some conductors are collaborative (you can reach in); some are exclusive
(you hand over the keys, and can always take them back by leaving).

This ships in the final product. It is a per-conductor property the developer sets and that
**users shop on** when choosing who manages their context. It is **not** a dev/test flag.

## Decision

### 1. Two postures: collaborative (default) and exclusive (opt-in)

A conductor is **collaborative** if it locks nothing — today's behavior, and the default.
A conductor is **exclusive** to the extent it declares a non-empty **lock-set**. This is a
per-conductor, user-selectable, first-class product property. Nothing in a user's world
changes until they pick a locking conductor and approve the handover (see §6).

### 2. The lock vocabulary — a free lock-list over three steering controls

Only **steering** — actions that change the agent's context — can be locked. A conductor
declares any **subset** of three named locks (a free lock-list, fully exclusive = all three):

| Lock | What it claims | Who normally holds it |
|---|---|---|
| `human-steering` | hand fold / unfold / pin / unpin / group / reset | the human |
| `agent-unfold` | the agent's `unfold` tool (forcing a block standing-open) | the agent |
| `tail-size` | the protected-tail dial (`setProtect`) **and** the tail's no-fold floor (see §7) | the human (size) + the host (floor) |

**The sacred tier — never lockable, in any way, by any conductor:**

- **Observation** — peek, the live map, the activity log, the budget readout. *You can
  always see; you just can't always touch.* (§3)
- **Budget** — the budget dial (`setBudget`) stays the human's, always. (§3)
- **The agent's `recall`** — an unblockable read of folded content. (§4)
- **Detach** — the kill switch, host-enforced, needs zero conductor cooperation. (§6)

**Guiding principle:** *tail-size is a conductor-domain dial (lockable); budget is a
user-domain dial (sacred).* The tail is a strategy's working assumption about what must
stay verbatim; the budget is the user's statement of how big the window is allowed to get.

### 3. Observation is sacred — never lockable

Even under a **fully exclusive** conductor the user still peeks at any folded block, watches
the live map update, reads the activity log (every fold / unfold / group, attributed), and
reads the budget. No lock touches any of this. Locking is about *touching*, never *seeing*.
Visibility is what keeps handing the keys to an autopilot honest: you can watch it the whole
time, and the moment you don't like what you see, you detach (§6).

**Budget is never lockable, ever.** We considered a weaker "budget is fixed once set" variant
and dropped it: pi can switch models and move the real context window regardless, so a frozen
budget buys a conductor no determinism it can rely on. Budget stays in the sacred tier with
observation.

### 4. The agent is a separate lock axis — plus a new `recall` tool

The agent is **not** folded into the human's lock. `human-steering` and `agent-unfold` are
**separate axes**: a conductor can lock the human and leave the agent free, or the reverse,
or both. And we add a new agent tool that makes locking the agent **on-mission rather than
blinding**:

**`recall` — an unblockable read of folded content.**

- `recall({codes})` returns a folded block's full content **as a tool result** — exactly
  like `read_file`. It does **not** mutate the standing view: no override is created, the
  block stays folded in context. The conductor then manages that tool-result block like any
  other (it can fold it again when it goes cold).
- `recall` is **never lockable**. It is the agent's counterpart to the human's **peek**.
- Unlike `unfold` (whose content returns *next* turn as a state change), `recall` returns
  content **in the same turn** — it is an ordinary tool call with an ordinary tool result.

**The distinction that makes one lockable and the other not:**

- `unfold` **overrides the conductor's decision on an existing block** (forces it
  standing-open, sticky) → interference → **lockable** (`agent-unfold`).
- `recall` **creates a new block via a normal tool call** (the tool result) → no override →
  **unblockable**.

**Payoff:** with `recall` unblockable, locking `agent-unfold` can never actually make the
agent *lose access* to its history — it only stops the agent from *forcing* a block to stand
open against the strategy. **"No silent forgetting" survives maximum lockdown.** An autopilot
conductor can take total control of the standing view and the agent can still always reach
back and read anything it needs.

**Symmetry the docs lean on:** **Peek : Human :: Recall : Agent** — both are unblockable
"look at folded content without changing the standing view." And **unfold : human-steering**
— both are "change the standing view," both lockable.

**Keep BOTH `recall` and `unfold` for now.** `recall` may eventually replace `unfold` for
agents; treat `unfold` as potentially transitional. Both ship this cut. (Settled; not reopened.)

### 5. Declaration shape and how the user sees it

The `Conductor` interface gains a **lock declaration** — a list naming the subset it claims;
additive, defaulting to **locks-nothing**. For an out-of-process conductor the declaration
travels in the `conductor/hello` handshake, which bumps `CONDUCTOR_PROTOCOL_VERSION` 2 → 3.

The lock-set is surfaced to the user as a **short checks-and-x's table** (which controls this
conductor takes over). The exact presentation can change later; the data is the lock-list.

### 6. Consent and transitions

- **Attaching an exclusive conductor** → an **explicit one-time confirm** showing the lock
  table — *"this conductor will take over: human steering ✗, agent unfold ✗, tail size ✗ —
  continue?"* Attaching a **collaborative** conductor needs no gate; it changes nothing in
  the user's world.
- **On consent**, existing human holds in a now-locked domain are **released to the
  conductor's baseline** — the human has handed over the keys, so the conductor authors from
  a clean baseline (the same way `conduct()` already works).
- **Detach (the kill switch)** → **freeze the current folded view in place and unlock all
  controls.** It is **not** reset-to-raw: dumping every block back to full content could blow
  the budget the instant you leave. The frozen folds become individually human-reversible
  (neutral/sticky, no conductor running), and every control returns to the human. Detach is
  **host-enforced and unconditional** — no lock can touch it and no conductor can refuse it.
- **Switching conductor → conductor** → the new conductor **authors from baseline** (already
  how `conduct()` works); its own lock-set and the §6 consent gate apply.

### 7. Approved = full control; no host floor on the tail

If a conductor declares the `tail-size` lock and the user approves, it gets **full control of
the tail — including driving it to zero.** Concretely the lock does two things:

1. The human can no longer **resize** the tail (`setProtect` is locked).
2. The host **stops treating the protected tail as an absolute no-fold floor.** The conductor
   may fold any block, recent reasoning included. A conductor that *wants* a protected tail
   simply doesn't fold the recent blocks; one that wants none folds freely. Accordion imposes
   no tail of its own.

**Absent the `tail-size` lock, the protected tail stays host-absolute exactly as today** —
the auto-folder, manual folds, and groups all stop before it, and a fold the tail grows over
heals back to live. So the tail's absoluteness is now a property of the *collaborative*
default, not of the host unconditionally.

The host keeps **no hard floor** on the tail (the owner overruled a proposed two-layer
host-floor; not reopened). The host's **only** remaining unconditional floor is
**provider-validity** — the outgoing message must stay sendable. The only things **never**
lockable are **budget** and **observation**.

### 8. Host enforcement — the load-bearing change

**"Human overrides always win" becomes "human overrides win for every control the conductor
did NOT lock."** Concretely:

- `ClampReason: "human-override"` fires **only in unlocked domains.** Under the
  `human-steering` lock there are no human overrides to win — the UI refuses the action and
  the engine refuses it, so none are ever created.
- `ClampReason: "protected"` fires **only when `tail-size` is NOT locked.** Under the lock,
  the tail is conductor policy, not a host floor, so folding a recent block is allowed.
- The **foldability gate stays in ONE place** (the engine) and remains the single predicate
  shared by `fold()` / `isFolded` / `computeFoldOps`. It simply gains the active conductor's
  lock-set as an input. There is **never a stricter rule on the wire than in the view, and
  never a looser one in preview** — preview/read-only obeys the lock-set exactly as the
  steering path does (the [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) preview rule is unchanged; locks are
  just one more rule it inherits).
- `host/event: humanOverride` (and the in-process `onHumanOverride` callback) simply does not
  fire for an action the human is locked out of — there is no override to report.
- The **kill switch (detach)** is the one capability no lock can touch and no conductor can
  refuse.

### 9. Additivity — nothing changes until you opt in

The default is **collaborative**. Every conductor that ships in `conductors/` today — the
built-in, `cold-score`, `cold-epoch`, `sliding-window`, `attention-folder`, and
`recency-folder` — declares **no locks** and keeps today's behavior. The
built-in's `conduct()` is **byte-identical**, so the golden test
(`conductor.builtin.test.ts`) is **untouched**. That untouched golden is the proof this ships
**additively**: a user who never picks a locking conductor never sees a single behavioral
change.

## The capability picture

Default (collaborative) world — unchanged from ADR 0007/0008, plus `recall`:

| Action | You | The agent | The Conductor |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Fold | ✅ | — | ✅ |
| Unfold | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Pin | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Peek | ✅ | — | — |
| Recall | — | ✅ | — |

What an **exclusive** conductor can and cannot lock:

| Control | Collaborative | Exclusive |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Your steering (fold / unfold / pin) | yours | **can be locked** |
| The agent's `unfold` | agent's | **can be locked** |
| The tail size + tail floor | yours / host | **can be locked** |
| Peek · live map · activity log | always yours | always yours |
| The agent's `recall` | always the agent's | always the agent's |
| The budget | always yours | always yours |
| Detach (the kill switch) | always yours | always yours |

## Implementation scope (for the build that follows this spec)

This ADR is the **spec**; the code is the next step. Confirmed scope:

- **`Conductor` interface** — add the lock declaration (names the claimed subset). Additive;
  defaults to locks-nothing. Lives in `conductors/contract/conductor.ts`.
- **Wire protocol** — bump `CONDUCTOR_PROTOCOL_VERSION` to 3; the lock declaration rides the
  `conductor/hello` handshake (`conductors/contract/protocol.ts`).
- **Host enforcement** (the load-bearing change, §8) — make `"human-override"` and
  `"protected"` clamps conditional on the lock-set; make the protected tail a conductor-policy
  concern under the `tail-size` lock; gate the human's manual actions on `human-steering`;
  gate `setProtect` on `tail-size`. All in `app/src/lib/engine/store.svelte.ts` (+ the wire
  mirror in `mapping.ts`/`plan.ts`). The `ConductorView` read surface needs little/no change —
  conductors already see `held` / `protected` / `grouped` / `protectedFromIndex`; the change
  is in how the host *responds*, not what the conductor is *shown*.
- **Command vocabulary** (`fold/replace/group/restore/pin`) — **unchanged.**
- **`recall` agent tool** — register beside `unfold` in `extension/accordion.ts`; resolve
  codes to folded content GUI-side and return it in the tool result (engine support, like
  `unfold`). Outside the conductor contract.
- **Kill-switch freeze-on-detach** — change `detach()` to freeze the current folded view +
  unlock, instead of reset-to-raw (`store.svelte.ts`).
- **Consent gate + lock-table UI** — the one-time confirm on exclusive attach, and the
  checks-and-x's lock table in the conductor switcher.

## Consequences

- **Conductor authors get a deterministic world** when they want one: an exclusive conductor
  knows its standing view will not be fought mid-run, which is what makes a real autopilot
  strategy testable.
- **The trust story is now revocability, not override.** "You can always overrule it" becomes
  "you can always *leave* it" — a single, host-enforced guarantee that holds no matter what a
  conductor declares. This is simpler to reason about than per-control override and harder for
  a conductor to subvert (it can't; detach needs no cooperation).
- **The agent can never be blinded.** `recall` being unblockable means even total lockdown
  preserves "no silent forgetting" — the agent's history is always reachable.
- **A founding line in the docs flips.** VISION ("This protection is absolute"; the
  capability matrix; "overrule it with a pin"), README ("Three hands on the same controls"),
  and CLAUDE.md ("human overrides always win") are rewritten to make the conditionality
  first-class, not a footnote.
- **Ships additively.** The golden test is untouched; every existing conductor is
  unchanged; a user who never opts in never notices.

## Rejected alternatives

- **Lockout WITHOUT a kill switch.** Rejected: revocability is the *replacement* trust
  anchor. Without an unconditional detach, an exclusive conductor could trap a user in a
  context state they can't leave — unacceptable. The kill switch is non-negotiable and
  host-enforced.
- **Detach resets to raw.** Rejected: unfolding everything on the way out could blow the
  budget the instant the user leaves. Detach **freezes** the current view and unlocks; the
  user can then unfold deliberately.
- **One blunt human+agent lockout switch.** Rejected in favor of two separate axes plus
  `recall`. A single switch couldn't express "lock the human, leave the agent free," and
  without `recall` locking the agent would mean blinding it.
- **Budget "fixed once set."** Dropped: pi can move the real context window by switching
  models, so a frozen budget buys no determinism. Budget stays sacred and fully the human's.
- **A two-layer host floor on the protected tail** (host keeps a small absolute floor under
  an exclusive conductor). Overruled by the owner: approved = full control, including the tail
  to zero. The host keeps no tail floor; provider-validity is its only unconditional floor.
- **Making observation lockable for a "clean room" autopilot.** Rejected outright:
  observation is the sacred tier. A source of truth you can't watch is not one you can trust
  to revoke; seeing is what makes the kill switch meaningful.
