/*
 * protocol.ts — the Accordion ↔ Conductor WIRE (ADR 0007).
 *
 * The in-process contract is `./conductor.ts` (`conduct(view) → Command[]`) — the main
 * way. This file is the ESCAPE HATCH: the JSON messages a conductor running as its own
 * process — in any language — exchanges with Accordion over a WebSocket.
 *
 * Topology: the CONDUCTOR hosts the WebSocket endpoint and Accordion connects to it as a
 * CLIENT. (The app is a webview; it cannot host a server. It is already a client to the
 * pi extension — this mirrors that.) A local conductor advertises its `ws://` URL in
 * `~/.accordion/conductors/<id>.json` (see `registry.ts`); a remote one is a URL the user
 * configures. Either way Accordion dials out.
 *
 * The command vocabulary (`Command`), clamp reports (`ClampReport`), and the per-block
 * view (`ViewBlock`) are all imported from the sibling contract so the wire and the
 * in-process apply path share ONE definition — there is no separate wire representation of
 * a block or a fold to drift out of sync. A `context/update`'s payload IS a `ConductorView`.
 *
 * Keep this dependency-free and runtime-pure (type-only imports, erased at build): a
 * conductor author copies these shapes; they should not have to vendor the whole engine.
 * See `docs/conductor-protocol.md` for a copy-paste reference conductor.
