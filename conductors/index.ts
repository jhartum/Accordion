/*
 * conductors/index.ts — the in-process conductor registry.
 *
 * Every conductor — built-in included — now lives under this directory and imports the
 * contract as a sibling (`./contract`), never from the app. The app compiles in-process
 * conductors and reaches them through this barrel via the `$conductors` alias; external
 * conductors attach over the wire (see `live/conductorClient.svelte.ts`).
 *
 * The built-in is no longer special-cased anywhere — it is simply the first entry in
 * `IN_PROCESS_CONDUCTORS`. Adding another in-process conductor is one line here, and it
 * shows up in the switcher and is selectable automatically.
